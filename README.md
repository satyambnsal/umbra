# Welcome to Umbra

Umbra is an experimental and progressive Aztec Protocol wallet!

In the vast and evolving world of Web3, a wallet is not just a tool; it's the gateway to a whole new universe. It's the first consumer application anyone encounters in a blockchain ecosystem, and it's pivotal in shaping the user experience. That's where Umbra steps in!

Umbra is at the frontier, leading the way in innovation and user-centric design. We're not just building a wallet; we're crafting the cornerstone of zero-knowledge application interaction design. With Umbra, you're stepping into the future of privacy-focused blockchain interactions.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📌

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- Aztec CLI (instructions below)

### Aztec CLI and Sandbox Setup

1. Install the Aztec CLI:

   For macOS and Linux:
   ```bash
   bash -i <(curl -s https://install.aztec.network)
   ```

   For Windows:
   - Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
   - Open a WSL terminal
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     bash -i <(curl -s https://install.aztec.network)
     ```

2. Ensure Docker is running on your system.

3. Start the Aztec Sandbox:
   ```shell
   aztec start --sandbox
   ```

Note: You must have the Aztec Sandbox running locally for this project to work correctly.

### Installation 💻

Install the dependencies:

```shell
$ pnpm i
```

From `apps/extension` copy the `.env.example` as `.env` and adjust the variables there.

Build the project:

```shell
$ pnpm run build
```

## Development 🛠️

After building the project, you'll find the extension files in the `dist` folder. To load the extension in your browser:

1. Open your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) and navigate to the extensions page:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions`
   - Firefox: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
   - Edge: `edge://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (usually a toggle in the top right corner).
3. Click "Load unpacked" (Chrome/Edge) or "Load Temporary Add-on" (Firefox).
4. Navigate to the `dist` folder in your project directory and select it.

The Umbra extension should now be loaded and visible in your browser's toolbar.

To start the development server:

```shell
$ pnpm run dev
```

This command will watch for file changes and rebuild the extension. After making changes, you'll need to refresh the extension in your browser:
- Chrome/Edge: Right-click the extension icon and select "Reload"
- Firefox: Click the "Reload" button next to the extension on the `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` page

Remember to reload the extension after each change to see the updates in your browser.
